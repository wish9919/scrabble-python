# This file is provided to you as a starting point for the "log_viewer.py" program of Project
# of Programming Principles in Semester 1, 2022.  It aims to give you just enough code to help ensure
# that your program is well structured.  Please use this file as the basis for your assignment work.
# You are not required to reference it.

# The "pass" command tells Python to do nothing.  It is simply a placeholder to ensure that the starter files run smoothly.
# They are not needed in your completed program.  Replace them with your own code as you complete the assignment.


# Import the required modules.
import tkinter # Used to create the GUI.
import tkinter.messagebox # Used to show pop-up information windows.
import json # Used to convert between JSON-formatted text and Python variables.
